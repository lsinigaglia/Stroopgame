# Color-Word Matching Game Prototype

This is a prototype for a color-word matching game, developed using Pygame in Python. The game presents the player with a word that represents a color (for example, "BLUE") and displays the word in a color. The color of the word may or may not match the color that the word represents.

## How to Play

The player's task is to decide whether the color of the word matches the color that the word represents. If the color matches, the player should click the "True" button or press the "A" key. If the color does not match, the player should click the "False" button or press the "L" key.

## Feedback

The game provides immediate feedback. If the player's response is correct, a green rectangle appears below the word for half a second. If the player's response is incorrect, a red rectangle appears.

## Technologies Used

This prototype was developed using Python and Pygame library. 

## Future Development

As this is a prototype, there are many potential areas for future development. These could include adding a scoring system, creating different difficulty levels, or developing a multiplayer mode.
